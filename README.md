![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/learning-project)


## What is this?
RutValidator is a simple web app made with React that allows you to introduce any DNI (Chilean RUT) on a input and it will tell you if it's valid or not at real time.

## Install
** I used [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry) & [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/) to develop this app
```bash
bun install                     # You can use npm, yarn to install dependencies
```

## Run

```bash
bun run dev                     # You can use npm, yarn to install dependencies
```

## Build
```bash
bunx --bun vite build           # Same as above
```
